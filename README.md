# SynchrotronMRT
A python/qt application for Synchrotron Radiotherapy (Python3.5 + Qt5.9).
This was born out of a need for image guidance protocols on the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron.
However it is slowly turning into a fully equipped IGRT program that covers dosimetry, treatment planning (basic functionality in the program or import a clinical treatment plan), image guidance and treatment delivery.

Requirements:
- Python 3.5+
- Qt 5.9+
- Everything in the requirements.txt file

Notes: 
- The master branch is the most out-of-date branch, but I expect this to change once I have finished updating some features.
- If you would like more detailed descriptions, hassle me for them! I'll do them eventually - I promise :) 
- Most of the helpful notes exist as comments in the python files themselves.
- Read the Docs is something I've investigated but haven't had the time to implement properly just yet.
